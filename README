In recipe 10.3 show how to write an integration test that expects an exception.

To run this recipe:

1) Create a database called sip10_it, if you haven't already done so. You don't need to do anything other than create
the database as the integration test script will create the schema and test data.

2) From the top-level directory, type

    mvn -e verify

to run the integration tests.
